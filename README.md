# hello-world
a pilot repository for geqilong

This is Ge Qilong writing the README.md file. Although I'm writing the file, I don't quite know what to write about this file. Because, judging from the file's name, the content should contain at least something about the project(aka, repository). Well, this is the README file of the repository called hello-world, which is my very first repository on GitHub. Being a software engineer, I intend to create my own code library by adding projects via github. Hope this will take me somewhere. That's it!
